EXPERIENCE
VISITING SCHOLAR, ML ENGINEER, PROJECT MANAGER
Center for Imaging Science | Johns Hopkins University, January 2019 – August 2019
• Implement distributed ensemble tractography with custom ‘inverse-native’ image registration to
facilitate normative structural brain network (‘Connectome’) analysis at the individual-level.
• Mentor and supervise team of interdisciplinary software engineers to repackage, test, document, and
deploy reproducible and high-throughput connectome mining pipeline that upscales analytic capacity by
3x orders of magnitude on cloud and HPC servers, achieving unprecedented discriminability
benchmarks and other analytic goals ahead of schedule.
• Innovate myriad graph statistical learning methods for connectomics, including multiplex embeddings,
multiverse graphical inference, graphical ensembles, and multi-species ‘connectome coding’.
RADIOLOGICAL TECHNICIAN, DATA ARCHITECT, GRADUATE MENTOR
Mood and CogNeuro Labs | University of Texas at Austin, July 2016 – August 2018
• Train and validate Bayesian, ensemble, and deep-generative transfer learning models to achieve 25%
posterior predictive gain in AUC above classifiers-as-usual for prognosis of chronic depression.
• Acquire, preprocess, and analyze 100+ MRI, fMRI, and dMRI scans, and develop scan sequences.
• Invent suite of geographic web-scraping and census mining tools for high-precision, data-economical,
and reproducible deep-feature synthesis that delivers 5-10% out-of-sample predictive gain for a
stacked ensemble of classifiers used to match individuals to an internet intervention for depression.
• Independently devise, engineer, and deploy a cloud-based LAMP server on AWS using HIPAA-
compliant EC2, ELB, and RDS-SQL to achieve scalable iOS / Android mobile sensing with HealthKit /
Fit API’s, activity monitoring, conversational audio analysis with ASR and NLP, real-time sentiment
analysis, continuous learning, and closed-loop treatment prompts with personalized push-notifications.
STUDY COORDINATOR, SOFTWARE ENGINEER, SYSTEMS ADMINISTRATOR
Social Cognitive Affective Neuroscience Lab | University of Arizona, July 2014 – July 2016
• Manage team of a dozen research scientists while coordinating two DARPA-funded studies that
investigate novel sleep-entrainment interventions for Traumatic Brain Injury and PTSD.
• Forge relationships with over 73 institutions and community organizations, while deploying
reinforcement-learned recruitment campaign based on targeted social media ads and SEO.
• In the processing of establishing a new research lab, automate systems of multimodal data capture,
entry, export, transfer, storage, preprocessing, and quality control to streamline standard operating
procedures, minimize data loss, and maximize efficiency of research team.
• Independently construct a 14-node, quad-GPU Beowulf cluster, configure and administer its
scheduler and ACL’s for a diverse team of users, implement custom SSHFS NFS and remote access
protocols, write and maintain library of dozens of custom shell scripts to minimize maintainence
overhead, and compile dozens of bleeding-edge neuroimaging applications for HPC analytics.
